I'm a third-year Economics student at [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es), specializing in Applied Economics and Quantitative Techniques. My academic interests lie at the intersection of data, finance, and economic modeling.

I’ve worked on the sell-side in Fixed Income and Structured Credit, starting with building Excel tools and conducting credit analysis, and later designing portfolio visualization systems using Python, VBA, and Bloomberg. I’ve also written market research and collaborated closely with brokers on portfolio construction.

Beyond academics and work, I tutor through UC3M's [Companion Program](https://www.uc3m.es/orientacion/en/companeros-grados).

Online, I go by "venatio" -- Latin for '*the hunt*' -- a nod to how I enjoy tackling problems head-on.

If any of this sounds interesting or you'd just like to connect, feel free to reach out.

### About this website

- This site is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
- The sourcecode is available under two repositories, open for reuse or adaptation:
  - [v3natio-website](https://github.com/v3natio/v3natio-website): contains all the Hugo project files.
  - [v3natio.github.io](https://github.com/v3natio/v3natio.github.io): serves as the `public/` front-end.
- Deployment is automated via GitHub Actions: every push to the main repo triggers a build, updating the live site.
