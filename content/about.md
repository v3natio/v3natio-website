I'm a third-year Economics student at [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es), specializing in Applied Economics and Quantitative Techniques. My academic interests sit at the intersection of data, finance, and economic modeling.

I've had the chance to work on the sell-side across some roles in Fixed Income and Structured Credit. Over time, I went from building Excel tools and doing credit analysis, to designing portfolio visualization systems using Python, VBA, and Bloomberg tools. I've also written market research and worked closely with brokers on portfolio construction.

Beyond academics and work, I tutor through UC3M's [Companion Program](https://www.uc3m.es/orientacion/en/companeros-grados).

Online, I go by "venatio" -- Latin for *the hunt* -- a nod to how I enjoy tackling problems head-on.
